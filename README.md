# Haskell Lox

This is an attempt to write Lox, the language from the wonderful book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)
by Bob Nystrom, in Haskell. I'm not quite sure how far I will get. I want to implement the front
end, i.e. the recursive descent parser and lexer. But as for the actual interpreter? Maybe not.
Maybe instead I'll write a basic compiler.

I'm very new to Haskell, so the code is a little rough. Hopefully I'll learn more as I write
more code.
